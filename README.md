# GameOfLife
Very simple REACT + Spring Boot implementation of Conway's Game of Life

## The Rules
Conway's game of life was devised by britich mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is considered a zero-player due to the fact that the only required inputs is the initial board state.

The behavior of the cells are dictated from a couple very simple rules. 

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. Any other live cells die in the next generation.
